# Ball Buster
This was a game created by me and Ian Boni (@IanBoni_ on Twitter/X) during the Game Maker's Tool Kit 2024 Game Jam event which lasted from August 15-20th.

The theme was 'Built to Scale' and our game represented the theme with the concept of shooting out bombs that, if collided with the same symbol, would merge into one, becoming bigger and having a more potent blast.
